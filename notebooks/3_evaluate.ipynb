You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax git push [remotename] :[branch]. If you want to delete your serverfix branch from the server, you run the following:\n",

A way to remember this command is by recalling the git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch] syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the [localbranch] portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be [remotebranch].”\n",

      "Question: I accidentally committed the wrong files to Git, but didn't push the commit to the server yet.\n",
      "How do I undo those commits from the local repository?\n",
      "Answer:  To undo commits from the local repository without pushing them to the server, you can use the git restore command, which is an alternative to git reset for undo operations in Git version 2.23.0 and later. The command to undo a commit is git restore --soft <commit>, which undoes the changes in the working directory and the index but preserves the commit message and author information. To undo changes to specific files, you can use git restore <file> or git restore --staged <file> to unstage a staged file. The git reset command can also be used to undo changes, but with a different behavior depending on the arguments provided. For example, git reset --hard <commit> resets the head to the specified commit, discarding all changes to the working directory and index. Git provides several ways to recover deleted or overwritten commits, and anything committed in Git can almost always be recovered, while unsaved local changes are lost forever.\n",

This removes the file from the staging area but keeps the changes in the working directory. Alternatively, you can use 'git reset <file>' to remove both the staged and unstaged changes for a specific file. If you haven't yet run 'git commit', you can also use 'git checkout -- <file>' to unstage a modified tracked file, or 'git checkout <file>' to unstage and discard all changes to a file. If you have already run 'git commit', you can amend the commit using 'git commit --amend' to include or exclude files.

      "error: Untracked working tree file 'example.txt' would be overwritten by merge\n",
      "Answer:  To force an overwrite of local files on a git pull, you can use the `--force` option. However, this should be done with caution as it can lead to data loss if the remote branch has diverged significantly from the local branch. If you have a local file of the same filename as on the server and want to overwrite it during a pull, you can use the `git pull --force-with-lease` command, which first fetches the remote branch and then performs a fast-forward merge or a three-way merge, depending on the remote branch’s state. If the merge results in a different tree object than the one that was already in your working directory, Git will reject the merge and exit with an error. To override this behavior, you can pass the `--force-with-lease` flag to force the merge and overwrite the local file. However, if the local file has been modified since the last commit, Git will refuse to overwrite it and exit with an error. In this case, you should manually resolve the conflicts and commit the changes before proceeding with the forceful merge. In summary, using `--force-with-lease` can be useful in specific scenarios where you want to ensure that your local changes are not lost during a pull, but it should be used with caution and only after careful consideration of the potential risks and consequences.\n",
