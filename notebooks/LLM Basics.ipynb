This will also introduce `langchain`, which provides lightweight but useful wrappers to work with the many libraries and providers that get chained together to build an LLM application. See https://www.langchain.com/ or try https://www.llamaindex.ai/ for an alternative.\n",

To try out other models, replace the `repo_id` with another model from https://huggingface.co/models, or see https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/ to use a non-Hugging Face Provider (for example, OpenAI)."

Some trees have broad, spreading branches, while others have narrow, upright branches. The angle and distance between branches can also affect the overall shape and growth pattern of the tree.

Branches can be created, deleted, and moved around as needed.\\n\\nThere are two types of branches in Git: local branches and remote branches. Local branches are created and managed within a local Git repository, while remote branches are created and managed on a remote Git server or repository.\\n\\nWhen working on a Git repository, it’s common to create a branch for each new feature, bug fix, or experimental change. This allows multiple changes to be worked on independently and then merged back into the main branch (usually called the “main” or “master” branch) when they’re ready.\\n\\nOverall, Git branches are a powerful and flexible tool for managing and organizing work in a Git repository. They allow multiple changes to be worked on simultaneously, make it easy to experiment with new ideas, and provide a way to manage merges and collaborative work.'"
